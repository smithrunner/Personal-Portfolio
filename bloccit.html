        <h1>Bloccit<br/><br/>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloccit is a recreation of the popular website Reddit, which is a message board where users have profiles and can create, comment, post and vote on any topic you could
         think of. I created Bloccit using Ruby on Rails and a MVC framework. I implemented each component of the application using TDD (Test-Driven-Development). <br/>
         <br/> The main components of the application were a system for user authentication, allowing for various access levels tied to different logins and a voting system based on a time delay + point method.<br/><br/>
         The application was deployed using Heroku and can be accessed through this link: <a href="https://frozen-escarpment-27424.herokuapp.com/">Bloccit</a>. Feel free to create an account and play around on the site!</h1>
