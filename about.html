            <div class="education"><h1>I am currently living in Austin, Texas which is about 3 hours south of my home town of Southlake. That might seem like a pretty
                                  straight forward life story but I took the most roundabout way to move those 3 hours. After graduating high school in 2012,
                                  I moved to Golden, Colorado to complete my B.S. in Geophysical Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines. Once I graduated in 2016 I realized
                                  snow sucks so I moved to San Luis Obispo, CA where I worked for the tech company MINDBODY in various technical support roles for a year.
                                  My time in California was full of amazing adventures, beaches, friends and a personal journey to find a more fullfilling career.
                                  On a whim I decided to buy a van and live in it. The following 4 months were pure hell for my worried mother in Texas but the most fun time of my life.
                                  I traveled all along the central coast of California while applying for different jobs, schools and educational programs.
                                  Eventually I decided to pursue Software Development through the online bootcamp Bloc.io while living in Austin, Texas.
                                  In June of 2017, I hopped in the van once again to drive home to Texas to pursue a career in software development.

                                       through highschool and then once in college, made triathlon my main focus. I was fortunate enough to be president of the Mines Triathlon Team and
                                       travel with them for races all over the country. College racing is sprint and olympic distance which was a blast but I believe I am better suited for
                                       half-iron and ironman distance racing. A tibia stress fracture in October of 2016 put a pause on my triathlon training for awhile but as of July 2017 I am back <tbody>
